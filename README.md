Code base for my xiao Esp32s3 BLE robot.  

Notes:  Use Esp32 servo by Kevin Harrington to control the ESC.  VERSION OF THE LIBRARY MUST BE 3.0.7 OR EARLIER, NOT LATER.
        Use bluepad32 by ricardo quesada for the bluetooth. 
        ESP32S3 Xiao can only use BLE, which means that an Xbox controller is required and is not compatible with playstaion or switch.  Maybe phones, but good luck with that
